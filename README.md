# rasFarmingCanning
All versions of the mod "ra's Farming & Canning" for the video game Project Zomboid. The mod's workshop page on steam contains info about the mod's content: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2951489608.

Release date: 24 Mar, 2023 <br>
Last updated: 18 Mar, 2024

The mod is only available for the stable build 41 version of the game. It is not available for the unstable build 42 and I probably won't update it since some of the mods features are now integrated in the main game. Bugfixes and other minor updates for the build 41 version are still possible ofc.

When playing the game on steam, you can install the mod by simply subscribing to it in the workshop.

Manual installation:
1. Download the most recent version of the mod from the "Releases" section.
2. Extract the .zip folder.
3. From the extracted file, copy the folder "rasFarmingCanning" from rasProfessions_[version]/Contents/mods/ to your Zomboid/mods folder.
