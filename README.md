# rasFarmingCanning
The mod "ra's Farming & Canning" for the video game Project Zomboid. Previous versions can be found in the "releases" section. The mod's workshop page on steam contains info about the mod's content: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2951489608.

Release (steam): 24 Mar, 2023 <br>
Last updated: 18 Mar, 2024

Coding is in lua.

The mod is only available for the stable build 41 version of the game. It is not available for the unstable build 42 and I probably won't update it since some of the mods features are now integrated in the main game. Bugfixes and other minor for the build 41 version are still possible ofc.

When playing the game on steam, you can install the mod by simply subscribing to it in the workshop.

Manual installation:
1. Download the above .zip file (the most recent version of the mod).
2. Extract the .zip.
3. From the extracted file, copy the folder "rasFarmingCanning" from rasFarmingCanning_[version]/Contents/mods/ to your Zomboid/mods folder.
