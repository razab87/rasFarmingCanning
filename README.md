# rasFarmingCanning
The mod "ra's Farming & Canning" for the video game Project Zomboid (build 41 version of the game). Previous versions can be found in the "releases" section. The mod's workshop page on steam contains info about the mod's content: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2951489608.

First release on steam: 24 Mar, 2023

Technical: the mod contains lua code and introduces new textures (png) and 3d models (fbx)

The mod is only available for the stable build 41 version of the game. It is not available for the unstable build 42 and I probably won't update it since some of the mod's features are now integrated into the main game. Bugfixes for the build 41 version are still possible ofc.

When playing the game on steam, you can install the mod by simply subscribing to it in the workshop.

Manual installation:
1. Download the above .zip file (the most recent version of the mod).
2. Extract the .zip.
3. From the extracted file, copy the folder "rasFarmingCanning" from rasFarmingCanning_[version]/Contents/mods/ to your Zomboid/mods folder.
